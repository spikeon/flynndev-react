            <h2>Career Objectives and Mission Statement</h2>
            <p>I have always had a natural talent for writing code. I would like to use this natural talent
                to the benefit of both myself and my employer, while continuing to hone my skills and learn
                new things about software development. My best fit would be in a well-structured
                organization that has high development standards. Eventually, I see myself working as a
                senior level Software Engineer or in a programming/architecture role.</p>
